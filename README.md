Task Management System

Overview

This project is a Task Management System similar to Jira or Trello. It provides a structured way to organize tasks within a workspace, using boards, lists, and cards to streamline workflow and improve productivity.

Features

Workspaces: A workspace serves as a container for multiple boards, allowing users to organize tasks by teams or projects.

Boards: Each board represents a project or category within a workspace and contains multiple lists.

Lists: Lists categorize tasks into different stages, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed."

Cards (Tasks): Each task is represented as a card within a list. Cards contain detailed information such as:

Task description

Due dates

Task completion status

Priority levels

Assigned users

Notifications for upcoming deadlines

Task Management

Users can create, edit, move, and delete tasks within lists.

Tasks include an option to mark as completed with a signal indicating completion status.

Deadline tracking ensures users stay on schedule with visual indicators for overdue tasks.

Drag-and-drop functionality allows for an easy and flexible workflow.
